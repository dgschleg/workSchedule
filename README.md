An easy to use online work schedule manager for hourly employees

The difficulty in coordinating hourly workers for a job is understanding when specific time slots are covered by an employee or not. In a situation where you have college students working as your employees this process can be even more frustrating as their schedule can radically change depending on class schedules which shift every few months.

Many institutions surprisingly still try to organize their hourly employee schedules by hand which is inefficient and time consuming. Most available commercial solutions are too bulky and require a lot of user input. This is inconvenient to hourly employees and it almost becomes easier to text or email schedules, which shows that they are not adequately addressing the problem. Employees need a quick simple solution they can check and update on their laptops and mobile devices.

With work schedule all an employee has to do is login and select or un-select available time slots which are distinguished with colored and uncolored squares on a calendar.
